# hello-world

Hello! I am doing  this to learn Git.
I will upload my code of the problems I solve for competitive programming.
I am not doing this to flaunt/help anyone; this is for my own benefit but if someone finds it useful well and good(Just don't quote me on the accuracy or efficiency or design of the solutions).
The repository contains a file called competitive programming which may contain files with names of the websites to which the respective problems in it are found on.
I will provide a link to the solution's question in the folder itself.
The solutions will be primarily in C/C++ but eventually when I do learn a few more languages with confidence (and if I have the time and will); I will add the solution in those languages as well.  
If anyone does get interested in what I am doing and want to give feedback or suggestions you can contact me on Instagram : narendra616 (may reply late).
